# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer Churn Analysis project using Excel. Includes data cleaning, churn rate calculations, and an interactive dashboard with insights by geography, gender, tenure, membership, balance, and number of products.
## 🏦 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn (when customers stop doing business with a company) is a critical metric for banks and financial institutions. High churn rates often indicate dissatisfaction and can significantly impact profitability.

This project explores customer churn data and presents insights through an interactive dashboard built in Excel. The dashboard provides a detailed view of churn drivers, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and design effective retention strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Calculate and analyze customer churn rate.
* Identify demographic and behavioral factors influencing churn.
* Compare churn across geography, gender, membership status, products, and tenure.
* Provide a visual dashboard for easy interpretation of churn trends.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains 10,000 bank customers with key features such as:

* Customer ID
* Geography (France, Germany, Spain)
* Gender
* Credit Score
* Tenure (years as a customer)
* Balance
* Number of Products
* Membership Status (Active / Not Active)
* Exited (Churned or Stayed)

## 📊 Dashboard Features
### 🔑 Key Metrics

* Churn Rate: 20.37%
* Total Customers: 10,000
* Average Credit Score: 651
* Average Tenure: 5 years
* Total Churned Customers: 2,037

## 📈 Visual Insights

Balance vs Churn Rate – Customers with higher balances churn more often.

Churn by Gender – Female customers showed slightly higher churn than males.

Churn by Geography – Germany has the highest churn rate, while Spain has the lowest.

Churn by Number of Products – Customers with only 1 product are more likely to churn.

Churn by Tenure – Mid-tenure customers (3–6 years) have higher churn rates.

Churn by Membership – Not Active customers churn more than Active ones.

## 📌 Tools Used

*  Microsoft Excel → Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
*  Pivot Tables & Charts → Aggregating churn data.
* Conditional Formatting → Highlighting churn trends.

## 🚀 How to Use

* Open the Dashboard.xlsx file.
* Use the slicers (Geography & Membership Status) to filter data dynamically.
* Explore each chart to understand churn drivers.

## 📢 Key Insights & Recommendations

Germany shows the highest churn → targeted retention strategies are needed.

Inactive members churn more → engagement programs should be introduced.

Customers with 1 product are highly likely to churn → cross-selling additional products could help retention.

Female customers slightly churn more than males → potential for targeted offers.
